Munkres solution to assignment problem, originally written by John Weaver.
This implementation seems to be disappearing from the net so I am maintaining a version now.

This is the first Debian package I've created. You can install it and remove it OK and you won't have any problems. But.. internally it does not fully comply to Debian standards yet. I figure I'll keept it in git while I learn the packaging process better.
